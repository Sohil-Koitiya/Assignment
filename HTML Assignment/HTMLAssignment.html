    <h1>HTML Assignment</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</b></p>
    <p> => No, Both are diffrence things. HTML Tags are used to hold the HTML Element and HTML Element hold the content.</p>
    <p><b>2.What are tags and attributes in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> <u>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.</u> They work together but perform different functions. <br>
    Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets.<br>
    Most tags must be opened and closed in order to function.<br>
    Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside and closing tag.
    </p>
    <p><b>3.What are void elements in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances. Void elements can have attributes. <br>
        The following is a complete list of the void elements in HTML : <b>area , base , br , col , command , embed , hr , img , input , keygen ,<br>
        link , meta , param , source , track , wbr.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>4.What are HTML Entities?</b></p>
    <p>=> An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand <b>(&)</b> and ends with a semicolon <b>(;).</b> <br>
        HTML entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). <br>
        You can also use HTML character entities in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
    </p>
    <p><b>5.What are different types of lists in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>-> HTML lists come in three main categories: <b>unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists.</b> <br>
        Each type serves a specific purpose and can be customized to fit your design and content needs.
    </p>
    <p><b>6.What is the &#39class&#39 attribute in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the case-sensitive classes of the element. <br>
        Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the DOM method.
    </p>
    <p><b>7.What is the difference between the &#39id&#39 attribute and the &#39class&#39 attribute of HTML elements?</b></p>
    <p>=> A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
    </p>
    <p><b>8.What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> <b>&lt b &gt</b> <b>&lt strong &gt</b> <b>&lt i &gt</b> <b>&lt em &gt</b> <b>&lt mark &gt</b> <b>&lt u &gt</b> 
        <b>&lt strike &gt</b> <b>&lt sup &gt</b> <b>&lt sub &gt</b> <b>&lt del &gt</b> <b>&lt ins &gt</b> <b>&lt big &gt</b> <b>&lt small &gt</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>9.How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</b></p>
    <p>=> Cell padding is used to create a border around the content area of a web page, whereas cell spacing is used for positioning elements (such as images or text) within that content area. <br>
        <b>Cell padding can be set through CSS, while cell spacing can only be controlled using HTML5.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>10.How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?</b></p>
    <p>=> It can be done by using the <b> rowspan and colspan </b> attribute in HTML. <br> 
        The <b>rowspan</b> is used to <b>merge or combine the number of cells in a row</b> whereas the <b>colspan is used to merge column cells in a table</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>11.What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</b></p>
    <p>=> Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Block level element can reserved all the space of perticular row. <br>
        Block elements have top and bottom margins. Inline elements don't have a top and bottom margin.
    </p>
    <p><b>12.How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> The <b>&lt a &gt</b> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. <br>
        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: <b>An unvisited link is underlined and blue.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>13.What is the use of an iframe tag?</b></p>
    <p>=> An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. <br> 
        They are commonly used for <u>advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive</u> content.
    </p>
    <p><b>14. What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</b></p>
    <p>=> The <b>&lt span &gt</b> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <b>&lt span &gt</b> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. <br>
        The <b>&lt span &gt</b> tag is much like the <b>&lt div &gt</b> element, but <b>&lt div &gt</b> is a block-level element and <b>&lt span &gt</b> is an inline element.
    </p>
    <p><b>15. How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page?</b></p>
    <p>=> The most common & simple way to add background image is using the background image attribute inside the <b>&lt body &gt</b> tag. <br>
        <u>The background attribute which we specified in the <body> tag is not supported in HTML5.</u> Using CSS properties, we can also add background image in a webpage.
    </p>
    <p><b>16.How are active links different from normal links?</b></p>
    <p>=> An Active link is a hyperlink that is currently being interacted with the user. Whenever the user holds the mouse button on the link and not released yet <br>
        or if right clicked on it, it will change its color into red, this is when the link will be in active state.
    </p>
    <p><b>17.What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</b></p>
    <p>=> We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags: <br>
        <b>&lt br &gt</b> tag – It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line. <br>
        <b>&lt p &gt</b> tag – This tag is used to write a paragraph of text. <br>
        <b>&lt blockquote &gt</b> tag – This tag is used to define large quoted sections.
    </p>
    <p><b>18.What is SVG?</b></p>
    <p>=> <u><b>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</b></u> is an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics. As such, it's a text-based, open Web standard for describing <br>
        images that can be rendered cleanly at any size and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards including <u>CSS, DOM, JavaScript, and SMIL.</u> <br>
        SVG is,essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.SVG images and their related behaviors are defined in XML text files, which means they can be <br>
        searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Additionally, this means they can be created and edited with any text editor or with drawing software.Compared to classic <br>
        bitmapped image formats such as JPEG or PNG, SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality and can be easily localized by updating <br>
        the text within them, without the need of a   graphical editor to do so. With proper libraries, SVG files can even be localized on-the-fly. <br>
        SVG has been developed by the <u><b>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.</b></u>
    </p>
    <p><b>19.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> HTML (HypertextMarkup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating and displaying web pages. <br>
        The main difference between them is the syntax and structure; HTML is more lenient in its syntax, while XHTML has a more strict syntax and follows XML rules.
    </p>
    <p><b>20.What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</b></p>
    <p>=> Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the web page. However, <br>
        both tags differ from each other as suggested by their names. <u><b>Logical Tags : Logical Tags are used in HTML to display the text according to the logical styles.</b></u> <br>
        <u><b>Physical Tags : Physical Tags are used in HTML to provide actual physical formatting to the text.</b></u> <br>
        <table border="" width="50%" height="500px">
            <u><h1>Logical Tags</h1></u>
            <tr height="70px">
