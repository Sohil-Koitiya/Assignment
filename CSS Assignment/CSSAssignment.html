            <h3>2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, there are some drawbacks to CSS. <br>
                It can be complex for beginners, leading to a steep learning curve. <br>
                Compatibility issues with different web browsers can also arise. <br>
                Overusing CSS can potentially slow down a website's performance.

            <h3>3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 has been split into different sections, <br>
                called modules. Each of these modules is making its way through the W3C in various stages of the <br>
                recommendation process. This process has made it much easier for various pieces of CSS3 to be <br>
                accepted and implemented in the browser by different manufacturers.

            <h3>5. What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
            <p>
                opacity applies to the element as a whole, including its contents, <br>
                even though the value is not inherited by child elements. <br>
                Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative to the element's <br>
                background, even if they have different opacities relative to one another.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>6. How can the background color of an element be changed?</h3>
            <p>
                To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. <br>
                Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. <br>
                Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>7. How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h3>
            <p>
                This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that <br>
                will help us to control the repetition of the image. The background-repeat <br>
                property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. <br>
                It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>8. What is the use of the background-position property?</h3>
            <p>
                The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. <br>
                The position is relative to the position layer set by background-origin.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>9. Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
            <p>
                The background-attachment CSS property sets whether a background image's position <br>
                is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls with its containing block. <br>
                The background is fixed relative to the element itself and does not scroll with its contents. <br> 
                (It is effectively attached to the element's border.)
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>10. Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
            <p>
                The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with <br>
                color, the complexity will further increase. Color is an inherited property while <br>
                the background is not.

            <h3>11. How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
            <p>
                To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the <br>
                &lt;center&gt; tag. All the elements within the &lt;center&gt; tag will be centrally aligned.

            <h3>12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
            <p>
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). <br>
                Even though every browser supports CSS, there are many inconsistencies in the <br>
                supported specification version. Some browsers even have their own implementation <br> 
                of the specification and have proprietary (vendor) prefixes.

            <h3>13. What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h3>
            <p>
                CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML <br>
                element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS <br>
                to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. <br>
                We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>14. What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
            <p>
                An embedded style sheet is declared within the &lt;head&gt; <br>
                element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, <br>
                rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets <br>
                applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>15. What are the external style sheets?</h3>
            <p>
                An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed <br>
                by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. <br>
                Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. <br> 
                The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="que">
            <h3>16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h3>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Some of its primary advantages are <br>
                increased website speed, time efficiency, flexibility, consistency, etc. <br>
                Its disadvantages are limited security, cross-browser issues, extra work for developers, etc.

            <h3>17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h3>
            <p>
                What is a selector? A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. <br>
                It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which <br>
                HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them

            <h3>18. What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>all</h4>
                <p>Suitable for all devices.</p>

                <p>Intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode.

            <h3>19. What is the rule set?</h3>
            <p>
                A rule set is a collection of one or many rules that are executed together <br>
                as a single unit against a specific set of records (either from one source or <br>
                a set of conjoined sources) and generate several levels of statistics.
