    <h1>HTML 5 Assignment</h1>
    <p><b>Q-1. What are the new tags added in HTML5?</b></p>
    <p>HTML5 is an upgraded version of HTML 4.01. New elements are added in HTML5 to write easy <br>
        and fast code to create complex, dynamic, engaging, and effective websites. These new elements <br> 
        add advanced functional features, improvised page layouts, and other improvements.  <br>
        The commonly used new HTML5 tags are &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;data&gt;, &lt;details&gt;, &lt;header&gt;,  <br>
        &lt;figcaption&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;meter&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;rp&gt;, &lt;time&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q-2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</b></p>
    <p>Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index.html . <br>
        Add &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls.  <br>
        Give both of them &lt;source&gt; elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it.  <br>
        These should include type attributes.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q-3. Semantic element in HTML5?</b></p>
    <p>Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. <br>
        Elements such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;article&gt; are all considered semantic because they accurately <br>
        describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q-4. Canvas and SVG tags</b></p>
    <p>Two of the most widely used web-based techniques for displaying graphics and images are SVG and Canvas. <br>
        Both of these are web standards for producing engaging web experiences. <br>
        Because SVG is resolution independent and consists of shapes, lines, and text, it can be <br>
        scaled up or down without losing quality. For interactive, data-driven, and personalized applications, <br>
        SVG graphics and images are perfect. On the other hand, bitmaps are used to store image data in the <br>
        resolution-dependent raster graphics API called Canvas. Drawing shapes and images on web pages is a <br>
        common practice, and making interactive games, animations, and visualizations is easy with Canvas.
